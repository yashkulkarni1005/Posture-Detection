# Posture-Detection
Human pose estimation from video plays a critical role in various applications such as quantifying physical exercises, sign language recognition, and full-body gesture control. For example, it can form the basis for yoga, dance, and fitness applications. It can also enable the overlay of digital content and information on top of the physical world in augmented reality.
 
 ## Objectives:
 
1.A robust algorithm to calculate successful rep count for knee bend exercise.

2.Adding a holding timer limit of 8 seconds.

3.Including a feedback logic in code,which should be triggered only when a person falis to stay in holding position till 8sec.


  ### Description:
1.Leg should be bent to start timer.

2.Slight inward bend is enough to start the timer. ( <140 deg)

3.After a successful rep, the person has to stretch his/her leg straight.

4.No restriction for back angle.

5.Consider leg closer to camera as exercised leg.
